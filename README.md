# Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm).  
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The starter code uses the Day.jsLinks to an external site. library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality.

# IMPORTANT

Make sure to clone the starter code repository and make your own repository with the starter code. Do not fork the starter code repository!

Before you start, clone the starter codeLinks to an external site..

# User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule  
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner  
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively  

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule  

WHEN I open the planner  
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar  

WHEN I scroll down  
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm  

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day  
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future  

WHEN I click into a time block  
THEN I can enter an event  

WHEN I click the save button for that time block  
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage  

WHEN I refresh the page  
THEN the saved events persist
